Behavioural changes:
✓ make it play with subversion (don't delete .svn folders on each save!)
✓ If a file is deleted from the filesystem, the corresponding item should be deleted from the database
✓ For pages with layout_id = nil (i.e. inheriting layout from parent), leave layout attribute blank (or <inherit> [layout_name] for info).

Make configurable:
- list of FILTERS (ability to add e.g. sass)
- list of CONTENT_TYPES

bugs:
- two layouts with similar names can confuse issues: 
  sitemap -> sitemap.html
  sitemap.xml -> sitemap.xml.html
